The image is 0.5 megapixels.
Shutter speed from bulb to 1/4
Changing the shutter speed does not change the image that can be taken.

This camera has a small sensor, so it can only capture a very small area in the viewfinder.
It is very difficult to focus. Even if you can make it, it's not always possible to shoot as intended.
The shutter and shooting work together, but you can't shoot in the dark 
because you're using the brightness to the sensor as a threshold.

Still, it's glad to have someone to build with and get excited about.

This is the limit of my current technology. I'd be happy if we all could make it even better.
